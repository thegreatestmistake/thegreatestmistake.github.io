					<h5><b> Name: </b> Eamon Devaney</h5>
					<h5><b> Background: </b> Born and raised in Oxford, made in SE1 </h5>
					<h5><b> Describe your main motivations for undertaking the Mongol Rally: </b> Like a true Mongol, I'm a bit nomadic and love to be on the move exploring new places and cultures. I've wanted to travel to Central Asia for sometime now, and there seems no better way to embrace the region than by driving a rusty Nissan Micra straight through the heart of it. </h5>
					<h5><b> Outline the relevant skills you bring to the team: </b> From previous travels I've discovered that I'm very talented at playing the dumb, lost tourist when trouble strikes [which it inevitably will do]. I've driven to Devon so have a rough idea of how monotonous long drives can be. I also made this website using my questionable coding skills which I'm sure will prove valuable on the road. Finally I'm a bit of a magician when it comes to Instagram hashtags so watch this space.</h5>
					<h5><b> Which part of the route are you most excited about: </b> With my historical bias, I'm really keen to visit some of the old Silk Road cities in Uzbekistan, such as Khiva, Bukhara and Samarkand, but I also think that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro could be absolute gems as well. </h5>

					<h5><b> Name: </b> Gabriel Hamlyn</h5>
					<h5><b> Background: </b> Dragged up in Mile End, polished off in Crundale </h5>
					<h5><b> Describe your main motivations for undertaking the Mongol Rally: </b> As a car and travel fanatic who likes to test himself to the limit, the Mongol Rally was an obvious choice. </h5>
					<h5><b> Outline the relevant skills you bring to the team: </b> As a Statistics student, my quantitive aptitude should come in handy for stuff like budgeting and rationing supplies. I like to think I'm endowed with lots of common sense and am also a phenomenal linguist as long as they speak English. </h5>
					<h5><b> Which part of the route are you most excited about: </b> The lap of Goodwood and potentially the NÃ¼rburgring are obvious candidates as a Formula One racing fan. Overall though, the opportunity the visit many a country to whom which I am unlikely to return and as someone who likes to laugh in the face of danger, I believe this 5-week campaign to Ulan-Ude provides a unique lens from which to view the world.</h5>

					<h5><b> Name: </b> Patrick van Breugel</h5>
					<h5><b> Background: </b> Born and raised in West London by a Dutch father and a German mother. Europe is working for us! </h5>
					<h5><b> Describe your main motivations for undertaking the Mongol Rally: </b> I am an adventure junky. I spent my gap year in Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana and Brazil, but there is plenty of unfinished business! The Mongol Rally somehow seems like the perfect way to take care of this. Curiosity may kill the proverbial cat, but the opportunity to drive around Central Asia in a wonky Japanese car with some mates proved too tempting. I am not entirely sure what to expect, but think it will compare well to cage diving with Great White Sharks in Australia! And of course, the opportunity to raise money for charity and help those less fortunate is something I feel strongly about. </h5>
					<h5><b> Outline the relevant skills you bring to the team: </b> : As a Geography student, we might have to call on my excellent map reading skills. I am not sure my linguistic skills will come in handy in those far-flung places, but you never know! As a keen sportsman, I promise to make sure the dream team stays fit as we undertake this test of endurance.  </h5>
					<h5><b> Which part of the route are you most excited about: </b> Uzbekistan because of its cultural history most definitely and Turkmenistan due to its unique geography and desert climate.
