					<h5><b> Name: </b> Eamon Devaney</h5>
					<h5><b> Background: </b> Born and raised in Oxford, made in SE1 </h5>
					<h5><b> Describe your main motivations for undertaking the Mongol Rally: </b> Like a true Mongol, I'm a bit nomadic and love to be on the move exploring new places and cultures. I've wanted to travel to Central Asia for sometime now, and there seems no better way to embrace the region than by driving a rusty Nissan Micra straight through the heart of it. </h5>
					<h5><b> Outline the relevant skills you bring to the team: </b> From previous travels I've discovered that I'm very talented at playing the dumb, lost tourist when trouble strikes [which it inevitably will do]. I've driven to Devon so have a rough idea of how monotonous long drives can be. I also made this website using my questionable coding skills which I'm sure will prove valuable on the road. Finally I'm a bit of a magician when it comes to Instagram hashtags so watch this space.</h5>
					<h5><b> Which part of the route are you most excited about: </b> With my historical bias, I'm really keen to visit some of the old Silk Road cities in Uzbekistan, such as Khiva, Bukhara and Samarkand, but I also think that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro could be absolute gems as well. </h5>

					<h5><b> Name: </b> Gabriel Hamlyn</h5>
					<h5><b> Background: </b> Dragged up in Mile End, polished off in Crundale </h5>
					<h5><b> Describe your main motivations for undertaking the Mongol Rally: </b> As a car and travel fanatic who likes to test himself to the limit, the Mongol Rally was an obvious choice </h5>
					<h5><b> Outline the relevant skills you bring to the team: </b> As a Statistics student, my quantitive aptitude should come in handy for stuff like budgeting and rationing supplies. I like to think I'm endowed with lots of common sense and am also a phenomenal linguist as long as they speak English </h5>
					<h5><b> Which part of the route are you most excited about: </b> The lap of Goodwood and potentially the NÃ¼rburgring are obvious candidates as a Formula One racing fan. Overall though, the opportunity the visit many a country to whom which I am unlikely to return and as someone who likes to laugh in the face of danger, I believe this 5-week campaign to Ulan-Ude provides a unique lens from which to view the world.</h5>

					<img src="img/paddy.jpg" class="paddy">
					<h5><b> Name: </b> Patrick van Breugel</h5>
					<h5><b> Background: </b> Born and raised in London, but from a European family with a German mother and Dutch father (weird mix I know) </h5>
					<h5><b> Describe your main motivations for undertaking the Mongol Rally: </b> My motivations stem from elusive travels during his gap year to Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana and Brazil. This has quenched my thirst for adventure and due to my thrill seeking attributes I believes that the Mongol Rally can be my next large escapade. It excites me because I have never visited many of those places, and would enjoy the thrill of every day being different and being uncertain about what the 5 weeks holds for me. In addition, it is a great chance to raise some money for Charity, which I am extremely fond off. I have aimed to help out the best I can on multiple projects such as doing volunteering in both Fiji and Ghana. This has always been a huge desire of mine to help those less fortunate, and I plan to work in a refugee camp after the Mongol Rally.</h5>
					<h5><b> Outline the relevant skills you bring to the team: </b> Map reading, general idiot, linguistic skills in Germany and that's pretty much it. Keen sports man so will keep everyone fit and focused for the trip </h5>
					<h5><b> Which part of the route are you most excited about: </b> Uzbekistan because of its cultural history. Turkmenistan due to its unique geography and desert climate. The Balkans - as a Geography student we learn a lot about the history of the region and to finally visit places such as Macedonia and Bosnia & Herzegovina is extremely appealing to me.
